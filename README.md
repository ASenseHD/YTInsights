# YTInsights

YTInsights is a "no-code" method authored by the ASense Team, licensed under the MIT License, which allows for the extraction of a user's basic information (such as the user's country, city, and operating system) through YouTube analytics.

## How It Works

YTInsights operates as follows:

1. **Upload any video as unlisted:** Upload a video to YouTube as an unlisted video.

3. **Watch the video on the main device:** The victim watches the unlisted video on their primary device.
4. **Wait for YouTube algorithm processing:** Allow a few days for the YouTube algorithm to process and generate analytics for the video.
5. **Access user information via YouTube Studio metrics:** After the YouTube algorithm has processed the analytics, access user information through YouTube Studio's metrics system.

⚠️ ~ **You should also watch the video on other devices from your household under different accounts, else youtube might give you the ``Not enough demographics`` error.**

This technique assures adherence to YouTube's privacy regulations and terms of service while making it easier to collect user-related data.
